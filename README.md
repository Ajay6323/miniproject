#Description : The project name is "Employee Management System" and it is built using the ASP.NET MVC core and Entity Framework.
 It implements full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database to manage Employee information.

#Approach: The project is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which separates the application's concerns into three main components: 
the model, which represents the data and business logic; the view, which represents the user interface; and the controller, which 
handles user input and manages communication between the model and view. The Entity Framework is used to interact with the Employee's database. This 
makes it easier to perform CRUD operations on the database without writing SQL queries directly.

#Features ##Home page : The home page of the application displays a list of all the Employees in the database, along with options to create, edit, and 
delete Employees.

##Create page : The create page allows users to add a new Employee to the database. Users can enter the Employee's name, Employee's Email, and 
Salary of Employee,Deartment of Employees.
 ##Edit page : The edit page allows users to update an existing Employee's name, Employee's Email, and 
Salary of Employee,Deartment of Employees.
 . ##Delete functionality: The delete functionality allows users to remove a Employee from the database.

##Details functionality: The details functionality allows users to display for a specific Employee's details in the database by name.
